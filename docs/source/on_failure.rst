On Failure
==========

In the same way that Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs, Programs + Resources = Failure. All resources are external to your program, even the memory, and an attempt to access a resource may fail. Writing
to a file can fail as the disk might be full. Reading a file might fail as its permissions have been made too restrictive.
