Porting your code to the Darien Library
=======================================

It's really straightforward. Let's assume you have the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /code/original_getfile.java
   :language: java
   :linenos:

This is a typical Java method that takes a parameter, returns a result, and may throw an exception.

As we know, parameters can be null. In this case, even if not null, ``filename`` may indicate a file that does not exist or is inaccessible.

Looking at the code, it appears that if ``filename`` refers to a non-existent file, a ``FileNotFoundException`` would be thrown. However, in this case, that can never happen. This is because
``FileNotFoundException`` is a subclass of ``IOException`` and so a ``FileNotFoundException`` will be handled at the catch for ``IOException`` at line 9. If this occurs, the code prints the stack trace and
returns an empty string as the string builder has not had any data appended to it. This may or may not be the intended behaviour. But it gets worse.

The method's behaviour is ambiguous. We cannot tell the difference between a file that does not exist and one that does exist but is zero length. One solution is to explicitly catch the
``FileNotFoundException`` and re-throw it so that the calling code is made aware that the file cannot be found.

Moving your code to the Darien Library
--------------------------------------

There are four areas to consider:

1. Method parameters that are null
2. Method parameters that fail a test that could cause the rest of your code to fail
3. Any exceptions or errors that are raised
4. What is returned from the method

Looking at the above code:

1. ``filename`` may be null
2. A valid filename may refer to a file that does not exist
3. An ``IOException`` that is not a file not found issue may occur, e.g., in between the file being successfully opened at the ``try`` on line 5 above and the contents being read with ``readLine``, the file may become unavailable
4. The code either returns an empty string or the contents of the file

For point 3., it is ``readLine`` that might throw an ``IOException`` and the number of ways an ``IOException`` might be raised is varied. For example, the drive the file resides on --- such as a USB thumb drive --- could be removed from the system. Or an external process deletes the file.

Re-writing the code
-------------------

.. literalinclude:: /code/original_getfile_rewrite.java
   :language: java
   :linenos:

1. Line two prevents filename from being ``null``
2. Line six tests whether the file exists
3. Line 18 wraps an ``IOException`` into a returned value. If an empty string is returned at line 21, the caller can be confident the file was zero length, removing our ambiguity
4. Line 21 wraps the file contents

For point 2. if the file exists at line 7 but does not at line 13, an ``IOException`` will wrapped and returned inside a ``FailureException`` type.

An additional case should be considered. Some of a file could have been read into ``resultStringBuilder`` when an ``IOException`` is raised. If this is the case, the rewrite ignores
the partially read file, returning the failed exception object at line 18. If this partially read file should be passed back, an instance of the type ``FailurePartialResult`` can be used.
