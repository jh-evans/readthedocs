The Darien Project
==================

The Darien Project for Java code makes handling Java code failure easy. It's well-known that error-handling code is buggy [1]. Using the library allows you to easily focus on the failure path to build better, working code more quickly.

.. quickStart:
Quick Start
-----------

The call to ``m.getPage`` below may fail in two ways: its internal HTTP GET might return a status value outside the 200 to 299 success range, or ``getPage`` might have encountered an exception. Either
way, the failure path will be executed.

.. literalinclude:: /code/main.java
   :language: java
   :linenos:

Darien Library tool support will write the code invocation for you, the ``if``, ``else``, and ``switch``, you see below so that you can focus on what you need to.

We handle the two failure cases like this (the implementation of ``getPage`` is defined in getPage_):

.. literalinclude:: /code/main_failurevalue.java
   :language: java
   :linenos:

The ``switch`` on ``page`` above is an example of pattern matching, released in Java SE 17 (https://openjdk.org/jeps/406) \[2\].

Running the above code, attempting to retrieve ``https://www.example.com/nosuchpage``, results in a 404 being returned, wrapped in a ``FailureValue``.

As below, when ``getPage`` is passed ``https://www.cannotfindthisdomain.com``, an instance of ``FailureException`` is returned.

.. literalinclude:: /code/main_failureexception.java
   :language: java
   :linenos:

All failure-describing types (``FailureValue``, ``FailureException`` and others) are subtypes of ``F`` (see the detail_), which in turn is a subtype of ``S``. ``S`` defines
``eval`` to return ``true``. ``eval`` on ``F`` and its subtypes returns ``false``. Within the failure path (the else), the appropriate failure instance (``fv`` or ``fe``) is created via the type switch.
That is it.

This approach focuses on the different kinds of failure, cleanly separating all cases, and tool supports write the handling code.

The Detail
----------

``S`` is a type that wraps an instance and defines two methods. ``unwrap`` returns the instance and ``eval`` returns ``true``. Generics are not used. This is explained in generics_.

.. literalinclude:: /code/S.java
   :language: java
   :linenos:

``Failure`` is the root of all failure-describing classes:

.. literalinclude:: /code/F.java
   :language: java
   :linenos:

All subtypes of ``Failure`` override ``eval`` to return ``false``.

The failure-describing types below (such as ``FailureValue``) are wrappers around an instance associated with the failure, such as a value or exception. This is because, in the failure case, the instance
of type T is not used; T is associated with a successful operation. However, for Java type correctness, ``Failure<T>`` must be written. 

``FailureValue`` is defined as:

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   public interface FailureValue<T> extends Failure<T> {
       public Number getValue();
   }

``FailureValue`` wraps a ``Number``. This type is useful when an operation has failed and a code value is to be associated with that failure, as in the HTTP GET 404 above.

``FailureException`` wraps an exception in the same way:

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   public interface FailureException<T> extends Failure<T> {
       public Exception getException();
   }

.. getPage:
`getPage`
--------

When ``url`` is ``https://www.cannotfindthisdomain.com``, ``getPage`` will return a ``FailureException`` that will wrap the thrown ``java.net.UnknownHostException``.
When ``url`` is ``https://www.example.com/nosuchpage``, ``getPage`` will return a ``FailureValue`` that will wrap the number 404.

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   public Success<String> getPage(String url) {
       try (CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.createDefault()) {
           final HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet(url);
   
           Result result = httpclient.execute(httpget, response -> {
               return new Result(response.getCode(), EntityUtils.toString(response.getEntity()));
           });
   
           if(result.status_code >= 200 && result.status_code <= 299) {
                   return new SuccessImpl<String>(result.page);
           } else {
                   return new FailureValueImpl<String>(result.status_code);
           }
       } catch(java.io.IOException ioe) {
               return new FailureExceptionImpl<String>(ioe);
       } catch(Exception e) {
               return new FailureExceptionImpl<String>(e);
       }
   }

``Result`` is a ``static class`` defined in the same class as ``getPaage`` used to pass the response code and the retrieved webpage from ``execute`` so it can be assigned to ``result``.

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   private static class Result {
       public final int status_code;
       public final String page;

       public Result(int i, String str) {
           this.status_code = i;
           this.page = str;
       }
   }

In fact, ``getPage`` looks perfectly reasonable, but the ``url`` passed in may be null or it may contain a malformed URL. In addition, the author of ``getPage`` may decide that any use of
``http`` should be rejected as only ``https`` is to be supported for security reasons.

.. generics:
Generics
----------
Types ``S`` and ``F`` do not use generics. This means that the ``unwrap`` call on ``obj`` must be cast to the type you are interested in. A generic ``S<T>`` would remove the need for you to type the cast. 
However, in the failure case (which has more types), you would be required to enter the type for the success case, e.g., ``FailureValue<String>``, which is redundant as the failure types are containers
for objects that represent the failure case, not the success case. Generics have not been used to ensure code brevity.

Using Interfaces
----------------

You will note that ``Success``, ``Failure``, and all the failure-describing types, are Java interfaces. You use these types when *using* the library, as a consumer, as in the ``main`` methods
in quickStart_.

When you base your code on the library, as a producer of success and failure cases, you use an *implementation* of these types as you can see in getPage_ (such as ``SuccessImpl``).

As an engineer, you reason about success and failure and how to handle these cases using the types. You give these types concrete meaning at run-time by using the ``Impl`` classes. In this code design, classes are purely a mechanism for expressing code and its reuse.

Focusing on Failure Leads to More Robust Code
---------------------------------------------

By focusing on failure, we can see that:

1. Any method parameter can cause your code to fail
2. All code paths are terminated at a ``return``
3. Any code that searches for something can fail

One way to address the first point is to use pre-conditions and return an appropriate failure instance. The Darien Library supports you here with its calls to ``FailureUtils.oneINull`` and
``FailureUtils.theNull``.

For point 2., the Darien approach is to return those exceptions you can wrapped in a ``FailureException``. This style is preferred over throwing an exception as where it is caught might be a long way from the point of generation, reducing options for addressing the issue. However, doing this is a matter of style and preference.

Code that searches for an item is common. A search will fail when the item cannot be found. The following extracts the right-hand side of a string containing a hyphen of the form "lhs-rhs".

.. code-block:: java
  :linenos:

   private String rhs(String input) {
       return input.split("-")[1];
   }

If ``input`` is ``hyphen-ated``, ``rhs`` will return ``ated``. But if ``input`` is ``hyphenated``, an ``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`` will be raised. This code addresses the problem:

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   private Success<String> rhs(String input) {
       if(FailureUtils.oneIsNull(input)) {
        	return FailureUtils.theNull(input);
        }

       if(input.indexOf("-") == -1) {
         return new FailureValueImpl(-1);
       } else {
         return new SuccessImpl<String>(input.split("-")[1]);
       }
   }

If ``input`` is null or input does not contain a hyphen, these cases are explicitly handled.
