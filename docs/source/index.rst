The Darien Project
==================

The Darien Project for Java code makes handling Java code failure easy. It's well-known that error-handling code is buggy [1]. Using the library allows you to easily focus on the failure path to build better, working code more quickly.

The call to ``m.getPage`` below may fail in two ways: its internal HTTP GET might return a status value outside the 200 to 299 success range, or ``getPage`` might have encountered an exception. Either
way, the failure path will be executed.

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Main m = new Main();

       // When called like this, GETs a webpage as a String
       Success<String> page = m.getPage("https://www.example.com");

       if(page.eval()) {
           System.out.println("The success path");
       } else {
           System.out.println("The failure path");
       }
   }

Darien Library tool support will write the code invocation for you, the ``if``, ``else``, and ``switch`` you see below so that you can focus on what you need to.

We handl the two failure cases like this (the implementation of ``getPage`` is defined in getPage_):

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   public static void main(String[] argv) {
       Main m = new Main();

       // When called like this,  returns a FailureValue, wrapping 404
       Success<String> page = m.getPage("https://www.example.com/nosuchpage");
   
       if(page.eval()) {
           System.out.println("Success");
       } else {
           switch (page) {
               case FailureValue<String> fv -> System.out.println(fv.getValue());
               case FailureException<String> fe -> System.out.println(fe.getException());
               default  -> System.out.println("As currently written, not possible.");
           }
       }
   }

The ``switch`` on ``page`` above is an example of pattern matching, released in Java SE 17 (https://openjdk.org/jeps/406) \[2\].

Running the above code, attempting to retrieve ``https://www.example.com/nosuchpage`` will result in a 404 failure being returned, passed back wrapped in a ``FailureValue``.

When the code is passed ``https://www.cannotfindthisdomain.com``, ``getPage`` below returns an instance of ``FailureException``.

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:
   public static void main(String[] argv) {
       Main m = new Main();

      // When called like this,  returns an instance of FailureException
       Success<String> page = m.getPage("https://www.cannotfindthisdomain.com");
   
       if(page.eval()) {
           System.out.println("Success");
       } else {
           switch (page) {
               case FailureValue<String> fv -> System.out.println(fv.getValue());
               case FailureException<String> fe -> System.out.println(fe.getException());
               default  -> System.out.println("As currently written, not possible.");
           }
       }
   }

All failure-describing types (``FailureValue``, ``FailureException`` and others) are subtypes of ``Failure`` (see theDetail_ below), whicch in turn is a subtype of ``Success``. ``Success`` defines
``eval`` to ``true``. ``eval`` on ``Failure`` and its subtypes returns ``false``. Within the failure path (the else), the appropriate failure instance (``fv`` or ``fe``) is created via the type switch.
That is it.

This approach focuses on the different kinds of failure, cleanly separating the various cases, and tool supports write the handling code.

.. theDetail:
The Detail
----------

``Success`` is a generic type that wraps an instance and defines two methods. ``unwrap`` returns the instance and ``eval`` returns ``true``.

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   public interface Success<T> {	
       public boolean eval();
       public T unwrap();
   }

``Failure`` is the root of all failure-describing classes:

.. code-block:: java
  :linenos:

   public interface Failure<T> extends Success<T> {
   }

All subtypes of ``Failure`` override ``eval`` to return ``false``.

The failure-describing types below (such as ``FailureValue``) are wrappers around an instance associated with the failure, such as a value or exception. This is because, in the failure case, the instance
of type T is not used; T is associated with a successful operation. However, for Java type correctness, ``Failure<T>`` must be written. 

``FailureValue`` is defined as:

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   public interface FailureValue<T> extends Failure<T> {
       public Number getValue();
   }

``FailureValue`` wraps a ``Number``. This type is useful when an operation has failed and a code value is to be associated with that failure, as in the HTTP GET 404 above.

``FailureException`` wraps an exception in the same way:

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   public interface FailureException<T> extends Failure<T> {
       public Exception getException();
   }

.. getPage:
`getPage`
--------

When ``url`` is ``https://www.cannotfindthisdomain.com``, ``getPage`` will return a ``FailureException`` that will wrap the thrown ``java.net.UnknownHostException``.
When ``url`` is ``https://www.example.com/nosuchpage``, ``getPage`` will return a ``FailureValue`` that will wrap the number 404.

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   public Success<String> getPage(String url) {
       try (CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.createDefault()) {
           final HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet(url);
   
           Result result = httpclient.execute(httpget, response -> {
               return new Result(response.getCode(), EntityUtils.toString(response.getEntity()));
           });
   
           if(result.status_code >= 200 && result.status_code <= 299) {
                   return new SuccessImpl<String>(result.page);
           } else {
                   return new FailureValueImpl<String>(result.status_code);
           }
       } catch(java.io.IOException ioe) {
               return new FailureExceptionImpl<String>(ioe);
       } catch(Exception e) {
               return new FailureExceptionImpl<String>(e);
       }
   }

``Result`` is a ``static class`` defined in the same class as ``getPaage`` used to pass the response code and the retrieved webpage from ``execute`` so it can be assigned to ``result``.

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   private static class Result {
       public final int status_code;
       public final String page;

       public Result(int i, String str) {
           this.status_code = i;
           this.page = str;
       }
   }

In fact, ``getPage`` looks perfectly reasonable, but the ``url`` passed in may be null or it may contain a malformed URL. In addition, the author of ``getPage`` may decide that any use of ``http`` should be rejected as only ``https`` is to be supported for security reasons.

Using Interfaces
----------------

You will note that ``Success``, ``Failure``, and all the failure-describing types, are Java interfaces. You use these types when *using* the library, as a consumer, as in the ``main`` methods
in quickStart_.

When you base your code on the library, as a producer of success and failure cases, you use an *implementation* of these types as you can see in getPage_ (such as ``SuccessImpl``).

As an engineer, you reason about success and failure and how to handle these cases using the types. You give these types concrete meaning at run-time by using the ``Impl`` classes. In this code design, classes are purely a mechanism for expressing code and its reuse.

Focusing on Failure Leads to More Robust Code
---------------------------------------------

By focusing on failure, we can see that:

1. Any method parameter can cause your code to fail
2. All code paths are terminated at a ``return``
3. Any code that searches for something can fail

One way to address the first point is to use pre-conditions and return an appropriate failure instance.

For point 2., this approach catches exceptions and returns them as a ``FailureException``. This style is preferred over throwing an exception out of the current method as this might be a long way from the point of generation, reducing mediation options. However, doing this is a matter of style and preference. There is nuance here.

Code that searches for an item in one way or another is quite common. a search mail fail as the otem cannot be found. The following extracts the right-hand side of a string containing a hyphen of the form "lhs-rhs".

.. code-block:: java
  :linenos:

   private String rhs(String input) {
       return input.split("-")[1];
   }

If ``input`` is ``hyphen-ated``, ``rhs`` will return ``ated``. But if ``input`` is ``hyphenated``, an ``ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`` will be raised. This code addresses the problem:

.. code-block:: java
   :linenos:

   private Success<String> rhs(String input) {
       try {
           return new SuccessImpl<String>(input.split("-")[1]);
       } catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException oobe) {
           return new FailureExceptionImpl<String>(oobe);
       }
   }

The above code is an improvement but it doesn't handle all error cases, e.g., ``input`` might be ``null`` or a character set test may be required before the split on the hyphen is executed.
