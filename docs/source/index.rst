The failure library
===================

The failure library makes handling Java code failure easy. It's well-known that error-handling code is buggy [1]. By making handling errors more convenient, you can focus on both code paths to build better, working code more quickly.

`The failure library is available here <https://github.com/jh-evans/failure-a>`_ 

<a name="quickStart"></a>
## Quickstart

The call to `m.getPage` below may fail in two ways: its internal HTTP GET might return a status value outside the 200 to 299 success range, or `getPage` might encounter an exception. Either way, the failure path will be executed.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main m = new Main();
    Success<String> page = m.getPage("https://www.example.com"); // HTTP GET a webpage as a String

    if(page.eval()) {
        System.out.println("The success path");
    } else {
        System.out.println("The failure path");
    }
}
```

The two failure cases are handled like this (the implementation of `getPage` [is defined below](#getPage)):

```java
public static void main(String[] argv) {
    Main m = new Main();

    Success<String> page = m.getPage("https://www.example.com/nosuchpage"); // returns an instance of FailureValue, wrapping 404

    if(page.eval()) {
        System.out.println("Success");
    } else {
        switch (page) {
            case FailureValue<String> fv -> System.out.println(fv.getValue());
            case FailureException<String> fe -> System.out.println(fe.getException());
            default  -> System.out.println("As currently written, not possible.");
        }
    }
}
```

The switch on `page` is an example of pattern matching, released in Java SE 17 (https://openjdk.org/jeps/406) \[2\].

Attempting to retrieve `https://www.example.com/nosuchpage` will result in a 404 being returned. `getPage` passes this back as an instance of `FailureValue` and the above code will print 404.

When passed `https://www.cannotfindthisdomain.com`, `getPage` returns an instance of `FailureException`.

```java
public static void main(String[] argv) {
    Main m = new Main();

    Success<String> page = m.getPage("https://www.cannotfindthisdomain.com"); // returns an instance of FailureException

    if(page.eval()) {
        System.out.println("Success");
    } else {
        switch (page) {
            case FailureValue<String> fv -> System.out.println(fv.getValue());
            case FailureException<String> fe -> System.out.println(fe.getException());
            default  -> System.out.println("As currently written, not possible.");
        }
    }
}
```

All failure-describing types (`FailureValue` and `FailureException`) are subtypes of `Failure` (see [The Detail](#theDetail) below), a subtype of `Success`. `Success` defines `eval` which returns `true`.
`Failure` and its subtypes return `false`. Within the failure path (the else), the appropriate failure instance (`fv` or `fe`) is created via the type switch. That is it. Easy.

This approach focuses on the different kinds of failure, cleanly separating the various cases, without over-focusing on success and forgetting to deal with failure.

<a name="theDetail"></a>
## The Detail

`Success` is a type that wraps an instance of `T`. `unwrap` returns the instance. `eval` returns `true` so your code will travel down the success path.

```java
public interface Success<T> {	
    public boolean eval();
    public T unwrap();
}
```

`Failure` is the root of all failure-describing classes:

```java
public interface Failure<T> extends Success<T> {
}
```

All subtypes of `Failure` define `eval` which will return `false` so your failure handling code passes through the `else` above.

`Failure` extends `Success` for the same type `T` so that `Failure` subtypes can be passed back wherever an instance of `Success` is expected ([see `getPage`](#getPage)).

The failure-describing types below (such as `FailureValue`) are wrappers around an instance associated with the failure, such as a value or exception. This is because in the failure case, the instance
of type T is not used as T is associated with a successful operation. However, for Java type correctness, `Failure` must be typed from `T`. 

`FailureValue` is defined as:

```java
public interface FailureValue<T> extends Failure<T> {
    public Number getValue();
}
```

`FailureValue` wraps a `Number` which is useful when an operation has failed and a code value is to be associated with that failure, as in the HTTP GET 404 above.

`FailureException` wraps an exception:

```java
public interface FailureException<T> extends Failure<T> {
    public Exception getException();
}
```

<a name="getPage"></a>
#### `getPage`

When `url` is `https://www.cannotfindthisdomain.com`, `getPage` will return a `FailureException` that will wrap the thrown `java.net.UnknownHostException`.
When `url` is `https://www.example.com/nosuchpage`, `getPage` will return a `FailureValue` that will wrap the number 404.

You can update `getPage` to more explicitly handle the other error cases when `url` is malformed or null.

```java
public Success<String> getPage(String url) {
    try (CloseableHttpClient httpclient = HttpClients.createDefault()) {
        final HttpGet httpget = new HttpGet(url);

        Result result = httpclient.execute(httpget, response -> {
            return new Result(response.getCode(), EntityUtils.toString(response.getEntity()));
        });

        if(result.status_code >= 200 && result.status_code <= 299) {
                return new SuccessImpl<String>(result.page);
        } else {
                return new FailureValueImpl<String>(result.status_code);
        }
    } catch(java.io.IOException ioe) {
            return new FailureExceptionImpl<String>(ioe);
    } catch(Exception e) {
            return new FailureExceptionImpl<String>(e);
    }
```
`Result` is a `static class` defined in the same class as `getPaage` used to pass the response code and the retrieved webpage from `execute` so it can be assigned to `result`.

```java
    private static class Result {
        public final int status_code;
        public final String page;

        public Result(int i, String str) {
            this.status_code = i;
            this.page = str;
        }
    }
```

## Using Interfaces within the Failure Library

You will note that `Success`, `Failure`, and all the failure-describing types, are Java interfaces. You use these types when _using_ the failure library, as a consumer, as in the `main` methods
in [QuickStart](#quickStart).

When you write your code to make use of the failure library (as a producer of success and failure) you use an implementation of these types as you can see in [getPage](#getPage) (e.g., `SuccessImpl`).

As an engineer, you reason about success and failure using the types and implement those types to give them concrete meaning at run-time. In this design, classes are purely a mechanism for
expressing code and its reuse.

## Focusing on Failure Leads to More Robust Code

By focusing on failure, we can see that:

1. Any method parameter can cause your code to fail
2. Any code that searches for something can fail

One way to handle point 1. is to use pre-conditions and appropriately return a failure instance.

Code that searches for an item is quite common. I write the following because I want to extract the right-hand side of a string of the form "lhs-rhs".

```java
    private String rhs(String input) {
        return input.split("-")[1];
    }
```
If `input` is `hyphen-ated`, `rhs` will return `ated`. But if `input` is `hyphenated`, an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` will be raised. This addresses that problem:

```java
    private Success<String> rhs(String input) {
        try {
            return new SuccessImpl<String>(input.split("-")[1]);
        } catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException oobe) {
            return new FailureExceptionImpl<String>(oobe);
        }
    }
```

The above code is an improvement but it doesn't handle all error cases, e.g., `input` might be `null`.
